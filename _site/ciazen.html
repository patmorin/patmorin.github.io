<p>You have a partial order $P$ of height 2.  The question “Is the dimension of $P$ at most 3?” is NP-complete.</p>

<p>Special cases to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$G_P$ is bipartite planar</li>
  <li>$G_P$ is 3-regular</li>
  <li>Containment of homothetic triangles(?)</li>
</ul>

<p>($G_P$ is the cover graph.)</p>

<h1 id="2-penny-haxell">2 Penny Haxell</h1>

<p>Theorem (Schnyder): Let $G$ be a planar triangulation.  Then there exists 3 linear orders $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$ of $V(G)$ such that, for every edge $xy\in E(G)$ and every vertex $z\in V(G)$ there exists $i\in\lbrace 1,2,3\rbrace$ such that $z\ge_{L_i} x,y$.</p>

<p>Question: Is there a list version of this theorem where each edge is assigned a list?</p>

<h1 id="3-tom-trotter">3 Tom Trotter</h1>

<p>David Kelly’s construction gives planar posets of height 2 and large dimension.  Some questions should have been asked:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can the number of minimal elements in this construction be reduced? (no)</li>
  <li>Can the length of the longest chain be reduced?  (no)</li>
  <li>Can this be done with one long chain? (no)</li>
</ul>

<p>Real questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do you need large standard examples for large dimension?  There are now examples where the dimension is twice as large as the standard example.</li>
  <li>Is the Boolean dimension of planar posets bounded?  (Uses arbitrary boolean formulas to determine if two elements are comparable.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This problem deals with showing the existence of a special type of F'ary\ embedding of planar graphs.</p>

<p>For distinct points $p,q\in\R^2$, we say that $p$ $(i,k)$-dominates $q$ if we draw a regular $2k$-gon centered at $p$ and the ray originating at $p$ and containing $q$ itersects the $i$th edge of this $2k$-gon.  We write this as $q \prec_{i,k} p$. (There is a small ambiguity here when the ray passes through a vertex of the $2k$-gon, treat each edge of the $2k$-gon as contain its counterclockise endpoint but not its clockwise endpoint.)</p>

<p>We say that a non-crossing plane straight-line drawing of a graph $G$ is $k$-transitive if, for every $i\in\lbrace 1,\ldots,k\rbrace$ and every path $xyz$ in $G$ for which $x\prec_{i,k} y\prec_{i,k} z$, the edge $xz$ is also in $G$.  Intuitively, this captures the idea that if $xz$ is not in $G$ then the path $zyz$ should ``bend significantly’’ at $y$.</p>

<p>Problem: Does there exist a constant $k$ such that every planar graph $G$ has a $k$-transitive non-crossing plane straight line drawing?</p>

<p>Same problem he posed in Barbados 2018.  (Cann every proper contact graphs of boxes in $\R^d$ be completed to a proper tiling of $\R^d$.)</p>

<h1 id="7-grzegorz-gulowski">7 Grzegorz Gulowski</h1>

<p>Two planar graphs with the same vertex set.</p>

<h1 id="8-gwenael-joret">8 Gwenael Joret</h1>

<p>Theorem (Pilipczuk, Siebertz): The vertex set of every planar graph can be partitioned into geodesic paths $P_1,\ldots,P_k$ in such a way that, if you contract each $P_i$ into a vertex, then the resulting minor has treewidth at most 8.</p>

<p>Meta-Problem: Can you use this result to solve problems on planar graphs?</p>

<p>Suppose $P$ has height $h$ with cover graph $G$ which is planar.  (May assume that radius of $G$ is at most $2h$.)</p>

<p>Known: $\dim(P)\le f(h)$</p>

<p>Known (but unpublished): $\dim(P)\le O(h^5)$.</p>

<p>Real problem: Use the Pilipczuk–Siebertz Theorem to improve this bound.</p>

<p>TODO: Read about this theorem and see if it includes a linear-time algorithm.</p>

<p>What is the size of the largest free-set in any $n$-vertex planar graph?</p>

<h1 id="10-jean-cardinal">10 Jean Cardinal</h1>

<p>Computational flip-distance questions.</p>

<p>$\alpha$-orientations: $G$ has $n$ vertices and a vector $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n$ where we orient the edges of $G$ so that vertex $i$ has indegree $\alpha_i$.  A <em>flip</em> involves reversing the edges of a directed cycle.  What the computational complexity of computing the minimum number of flips required to convert one $\alpha$-orientation of $G$ into another?</p>

<p>This question is open even if $G$ is planar.</p>

<h1 id="11-kolja-knauer">11 Kolja Knauer</h1>

<p>Basil Coeteux: Two posets $P$ and $Q$.  Consider $P\cup Q$.  This is, in general not a poset.  What is the complexity of finding the largest poset contained in $P\cup Q$.</p>

<h1 id="12-oswin-aicholzer">12 Oswin Aicholzer</h1>

<p>A (topological) drawing of $K_n$ is good if no two edges incident to a common vertex cross, no two edges cross more than once, no edge crosses itself, and no two edges are tangent.  (This is sometimes called a topological graph.)</p>

<p>Problem: Does every good drawing of $K_n$ contain a non-crossing Hamiltonian cycle?</p>

<p>The strongest such result is that every good drawing of $K_n$ contains a non-crossing matching of size $\Omega(n^{2/3})$.</p>

<h1 id="13-birgit-vogtenhubersp">13 Birgit Vogtenhuber(sp?)</h1>

<p>Straight-line drawing of $K_n$ with no three points collinear.  Want to $k$-colour the edges in such a way that the number of monochromatic crossings is minimized. How fast can the best colouring be found?  Start with the case $k=2$.</p>

<p>Remark: For any fixed $k$, the number of monochromatic crossings will always be $\Theta(n^4)$.</p>

<p>Remark: The problem is NP-complete if $K_n$ is replaced with an arbitrary graph with vertices in convex position. In fact, even if the graph is a matching (by colouring intersection graphs of segments whose vertices are in convex position)</p>

<h1 id="14-kolja-knauer">14 Kolja Knauer</h1>

<p>Partition the vertices of a planar graph $G$ into two sets $A$ and $B$ so that</p>

<ul>
  <li>$A$ and $B$ each induce forests (not possible)</li>
  <li>$A$ and $B$ each induce chordal graphs (possible by Li and Mohar)</li>
  <li>$A$ induces a chordal graph and $B$ induces a forest (this is the question)</li>
</ul>

<p>Related problem: Does every $n$ vertex planar graph have a subset of $n/2$ vertices that induce a tree?  (Hard open problem)</p>

<p>What about a set of size $n/2$ that induces a chordal graph? (Don’t know.)</p>

<p>Queue layouts for posets.  Let $G$ be the cover graph of a poset $P$.  The queue number of $P$ is the minimum, over all linear orderings of $V(G)$ consistent with $P$ of the number of colours needed to avoid monochromatic rainbows.</p>

<p>$\DeclareMathOperator{\qn}{qn}\DeclareMathOperator{\wi}{width}$
Conjecture $\qn(P)\le\wi(P)$.</p>

<p>Piotr and others have shown that, for planar posets $P$, $\qn(P)\le 3\wi(P)$.</p>
