<h1 id="the-original-page">The Original Page</h1>

<p>$\newcommand{\Q}{\mathcal{Q}}\newcommand{\X}{\mathcal{X}}\newcommand{\D}{\mathcal{D}}$This is a summary of Jiun-Jie Wang’s new paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02114">Layouts for Plane Graphs on Constant Number of Tracks</a>.  These notes are mainly to help me understand the paper.</p>

<h1 id="the-big-picture">The Big Picture</h1>

<p>$\DeclareMathOperator{\tn}{tn}$A $t$-<em>track assignment</em> of a graph $G$ is a (not necessarily proper) $t$-colouring $c:V(G)\to\{1,\ldots,t\}$ of $G$’s vertices, along with a total ordering $&lt;_i$ of the vertices in each colour class $i\in\{1,\ldots,t\}$.  An <em>X-crossing</em> in a track assignment is a pair of edges $vw$ and $xy$ with $c(v)=c(x)=i$, $c(w)=c(y)=j$, $v&lt;_i x$, and $w&lt;_j y$.  The <em>span</em> of a track assignment $(c,&lt;_{1},\ldots,&lt;_t)$ is the maximum value $|c(u)-c(w)|$ where $uw$ is an edge of $G$.</p>

<p>The <em>track number</em> $\tn(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum value of $t$ for which $G$ has a $t$-track assignment $(c,&lt;_{1},\ldots,&lt;_t)$ such that $c$ is a proper colouring and that has no X-crossings.</p>

<!-- A $(k,t)$-track layout of $G$ is a $t$-track assignment along with a $k$-colouring $s:E(G)\to\\{1,\ldots,k\\}$ of $G$'s edges in which the edges of each X-crossing are assigned two different colours.  A $(1,t)$-track layout is called a $t$-track layout.  The minimum $t$ for which $G$ has a $t$-track layout is called the *track number* of $G$, and is denoted by $\tn(G)$ -->

<p>It follows from gluing together results by <a href="https://www.emis.de/journals/DMTCS/pdfpapers/dm070111.pdf">Dujmovic and Wood</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0407033">Dujmovic, Por, and Wood</a> that if $G$ has a track assignment $(c,&lt;_{1},\ldots,&lt;_t)$ for which</p>

<ol>
  <li>the queue number of the subgraph induced by each colour class of $c$ is at most $\Q$;</li>
  <li>the largest set of pairwise X-crossing edges is at most $\X$; and</li>
  <li>the span of $c$ is at most $\D$,</li>
</ol>

<p>then $\tn(G) \le f(\Q,\X,\D)$ for some function $f:\N^3\to \N$.</p>

<p>Therefore, it suffices to find a track assignment for which $\Q,\X,\D\in O(1)$.  From now on, we’ll call this a $(\Q,\X,\D)$-layout. (Wang calls it a $(\Q,\X,\D)$-well-placed layout in a ladder $\mathcal{H}$.)</p>

<h1 id="key-definitions">Key Definitions</h1>

<p>These are my interpretations of some key definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <em>layer</em> is a horizontal line.  Layers proceed downward, with higher numbered layers below lower numbered layers.</li>
  <li>A <em>layerlike graph</em> is a plane graph where the vertices are assigned to layers $1,\ldots,k$, and there is an ordering of the vertices on each layer with the restriction that edges always join two vertices on the same layer or on consecutive layers.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>A layerlike graph Π is a graph whose vertices are partitioned and placed on contiguous layers such that no edge is placed between any two non-contiguous layers and no edges are crossing.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>A <em>downpointing triangle</em> in a layerlike graph is a cycle with all but one vertex on layer $i$ and the remaining vertex on layer $i+1$.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given a layerlike graph Π, a down-pointing triangle ▽ is a a cycle (l, · · · , r, m) that vertices on the cycle (l, · · · , r, m) are on the two contiguous layers where the path from l to r are on the upper layer and the vertex m is on the lower layer</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>A <em>bowl</em> in a layerlike graph is a cycle with all vertices on the same layer.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>A bowl ♥ is a cycle (l, · · · , r) that the cycle are on the same layer where each vertex of the cycle is on the same layer.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>A <em>composite-layerlike graph</em> is a plane graph that has a <em>backbone</em> $K$ that is a layerlike graph.  Each bowl $\heartsuit$ of $K$ can contain a composite-layerlike graph whose first layer is $\heartsuit$.  Each downpointing triangle $\triangledown$ of $K$ can contain a composite-layerlike graph whose first layer is the top layer of $\triangledown$.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>A composite-layerlike graph G can be recursively defined as follows: G consists of a layerlike graph Π such that each bowl ♥ of G has a smaller composite-layerlike graph G1 where G1’s first layer is the bowl ♥, and each down-pointing triangle ▽ has a composite-layerlike graph G2 where the first layer of G2 is the upper layer of ▽.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This object should really be called a composite-layerlike embedding of a plane graph.</p>

<h1 id="theorem-2">Theorem 2</h1>

<p>This theorem says that, if $G$ is a $(\Q,\X,\D)$-layout, then $G$ can also be drawn as a $(\Q,\X,O(\D))$-well-placed graph with only $O(\D)$ layers.</p>

<p>The proof of this is to wrap the graph onto $O(\D)$ layers.  The fact that the edge span is $\D$ ensures that this wrapping doesn’t increase $\Q$ or $\X$. This is basically the original wrapping argument from [<a href="http://cglab.ca/~morin/publications/gd/treewidth-sicomp.pdf">1</a>]. But actually, I don’t think this is needed since it we can use one of the results in one the {Dujmovic, Por, Morin, Wood} papers.</p>

<h1 id="section-3">Section 3</h1>

<p>This section discusses how to take a composite-layerlike (embedding of a planar) graph $G$ and turn it into a $(\Q,\X,\D)$-layout with $\Q,\X,\D\in O(1)$.  Part of this Section includes Conjecture 1, which is later proved in Section 7.</p>

<h1 id="section-4">Section 4</h1>

<p>This section shows how to find a composite-layerlike embedding of a plane graph.  More specificially, it shows (in Theorem 4) that a 1-subdivision of any planar graph $G$ has a composite-layerlike embedding.</p>

<p>I found this proof (which is supposedly the easy part of the paper) almost impossible to follow.  In fact, I think there’s a counterexample.  Let me quote the paper:$\newcommand{\OO}{\mathcal{O}}\newcommand{\GG}{\mathcal{G}}$</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this section,
we show how to reform a plane graph $G$ to a composite-layerlike graph $\GG$.
Let $G$ be a plane graph and $\OO(G)$ be its outer boundary. Each layer in a composite-layerlike graph $\GG$ can be recursively defined as follows:
the first layer is $\OO(G)$ and $\OO_{G}$ is placed as clockwise order $(m, u_1,u_2, \cdots)$. Then $(\OO_1, \OO_2, \cdots, \OO_p)$ are the sequential maximal inner cycles inside $\OO$ such that for each maximal inner cycle $\OO_i, 1\leq i\leq p$, there are some vertices on $\OO_i$ connecting to the vertex $m$.
Now for each maximal inner cycle $\OO_i, 1\leq i\leq p$, we can walk around the cycle $\OO_i$ by clockwise order to get two contiguous vertices $(L^U(\OO_i)=(v^i_1=u^i_y, v^i_2, \cdots, v^i_x=u^i_1), L^B(\OO_i)=(u^i_1=v^i_x, u^i_2, \cdots, u^i_y=v^i_1) )$ where each vertex of $L^U(\OO_i)$ don’t connect to the vertex $m$ except the first and last vertices ${v^i_1, v^i_y}$ of $L^U(\OO_i)$ and each vertex of $L^B(\OO_i)$ connects to the vertex $m$.
All maximal inner cycles $(\OO_1, \OO_2, \cdots, \OO_p)$ can be placed on the second layer as the order: $(\OO_1, \OO_2, \cdots, \OO_p)$. Moreover,
for each maximal inner cycle $\OO_i$, $\OO_i$ is placed on the second layer from the vertex $u^i_1$ by clockwise order as: $(v^i_1=u^i_y, v^i_2, \cdots, v^i_x=u^i_y, u^i_{y-1}, \cdots, u^i_2)$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following picture illustrates the problem:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="images/tracknumber-example.svg" alt="tracknumber-example" /></p>

<p>The second figure represents my understanding of the preceding paragraph, which could be incorrect.  However, if the goal is that $\OO_1$, $\OO_2$, and $\OO_3$ should all be bowls on the same layer, then I don’t see any way to resolve the fact that $\OO_2$ shares two non-adjacent vertices with $\OO_1$ and $\OO_3$.</p>

<p>There is another problem still:  If the graph $G$ is the <em>stellated triangulation</em>.  In this graph, the outer face $\OO(G)$ is a cycle of length three $v_1,v_2,v_3$, which becomes a bowl $\heartsuit$ of length three on layer 0.  Now, the three vertices of $\heartsuit$ are each connected to the same vertex $v$.  Though the above description doesn’t say what to do in this case, the only reasonable interpretation is to place $v$ onto the layer 1, inside $\heartsuit$.  In this case, each of the down-pointing triangles $v_1,v_2,v$, $v_2,v_3,v$ and $v_1,v_3,v$ has something inside of it,  The problem is that $v_1,v_3,v_3$ is not really a downpointing triangle, at least not in the way that every other triangle is downpointing.</p>

<p>obtained by starting with a triangle and splitting it into three triangles, and splitting each of these into three triangles.</p>

<p>$K_3$ trianguluation,</p>

<h1 id="section-5">Section 5</h1>

<p>This is where they prove Theorem 6, which is that every plane graph has $O(1)$ track number.  This is where I have a problem.</p>

<h1 id="section-6">Section 6</h1>
<p>In this section, they prove how to get a $(\Q,\X,\D)$-well-placed layout for something called a <em>raising fan</em>.  This is later used in Section 7, I think.</p>

<h1 id="section-7">Section 7</h1>

<p>In this section, they show how to find a skeleton in a region so that the skeleton has a $(\Q,\X,\D)$-well-placed layout.</p>
