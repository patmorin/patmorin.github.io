    <p>An even-length sequence $a=st$ is an <em>anagram</em> if $s$ is a permutation of $t$. A sequence is <em>anagram-free</em> if it does not contain any anagram as a contiguous subsequence.  A colouring of a graph $G$ is <em>anagram-free</em> if the colour sequence encountered on any simple path in $G$ is anagram-free.
Equivalently, a colouring is anagram-free if there is no path in $G$ whose colour sequence is an anagram.  The minimum number of colours in an anagram-free colouring of $G$ is called the <em>anagram-free chromatic number</em> of $G$ and is denoted $\pi_\alpha(G)$.</p>

<p>A classic result on combinatorics of the strings is that the $n$-vertex path $P_n$ has $\pi_\alpha(P_n)\le 4$ with equality for $n\ge 7$.</p>

<div class="problem">
  What is the anagram-free chromatic number of the $2\times n$ grid?
</div>

<p>Using divide-and-conquer, we obtain an anagram-free colouring of the $2\times n$ using grid $\log_2(n+1)$ colours. More generally, any graph $G$ of treewidth $k$ has an $\pi_\alpha(G)\in O(k\log n)$.  For graphs $G$ coming from hereditary families with treewidth $O(n^\delta)$, $0&lt;\delta&lt;1$, $\pi_\alpha(G)\in O(n^{\delta})$.  So, for examples, $\pi_\alpha(G)\in O(\sqrt{n})$ for any $n$-vertex planar graph $G$.  It is worth noting that this divide-and-conquer approach gives a stronger property: The smallest colour on any path occurs exactly once.  This stronger type of colouring is known as a <em>vertex ranking</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09062">Kamčev, Łuczak, and Sudakov</a> show that the anagram-free chromatic number of $n$-vertex binary trees can be $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n/\log\log n})$. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01117">Wilson and Wood</a> for more results on trees.</p>

<div class="problem">
  What is largest anagram-free chromatic number of any $n$-vertex tree?
</div>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01117">Wilson and Wood</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09062">Kamčev, Łuczak, and Sudakov</a>
show that the anagram-free chromatic number of $n$-vertex planar graphs can be $\Omega(\log n)$.  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01646">Carmi, Dujmović and Morin</a> use a different construction (with pathwidth 3) that proves the same $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound.</p>

<div class="problem">
  What is largest anagram-free chromatic number of any $n$-vertex planar graph?
</div>

<p>We do not even know a bound of $o(\sqrt{n})$ for the $\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}$ grid. I would be willing to bet that there are $n$-vertex planar graphs with anagram-free chromatic number $\Omega(n^\epsilon)$ for some $\epsilon &gt;0$.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01117">Wilson and Wood</a> also show that any tree $T$ of pathwidth $k$ has $\pi_\alpha(T)\le 4k+1$, thus avoiding the $O(\log n)$ factor of the divide-and-conquer algorithm.  They do this by choosing a path $P$ in $T$ whose removal disconnects $T$ into components that each have pathwidth at most $k-1$ and colouring $P$ using an anagram-free 4-colouring.  Their result doesn’t generalize from trees to graphs: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01646">Carmi, Dujmović and Morin</a> show that there are $kn$-vertex graphs of pathwidth $k$ that require $\Omega(k\log n)$ colours.</p>

<h1 id="outerplanar-graphs-of-small-pathwidth">Outerplanar graphs of small pathwidth</h1>

<p>Somewhere between Wilson and Wood’s upper bound of $4k+1$ for trees of pathwidth $k$ and the lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)$ for planar graphs of pathwidth 3 is the following question, that arose through discussions with Therese Biedl:</p>

<div class="problem">
  What is largest anagram-free chromatic number of any $n$-vertex outerplanar graph of pathwidth $k$?
</div>

<p>At the heart of this question is the following:</p>

<div class="problem">
  What is largest anagram-free chromatic number of any $n$-vertex outerplanar graph of pathwidth $2$?
</div>

<p>Outerplanar graphs of pathwidth 2 include  the $2\times n$ square grid with one diagonal edge inside each square.  This is <em>very</em> close to the lower bound graph that requires $\Omega(\log n)$ colours.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> We (Therese and I) made some progress today (May 29, 2019).</p>

<div class="theorem">
  Outerplanar graph of pathwidth 3 and maximum-degree $\Delta$ have anagram-free chromatic-*index* $O(\Delta)$.
</div>

<p>The proof is by looking at particle greedy path $P=v_1,\ldots,v_m$ in such a graph and computing an anagram-free 4-colouring the edges of $P$.  Each edge of $P$ makes a 2-vertex cutset $\lbrace v_i,v_i+1\rbrace$.  The remaining edges are coloured with colours that encode the edges of $P$ that they are skipping over.  (Essentially, for every $v_i$ in $P$ we find a triple of edges such that any path from $v_i$ to $v_{i+1},\ldots,v_m$ must use exactly one edge from this triple.)  In this way, if some path $P’$ has an anagram colouring we can relate this to a subpath of $P$ that has an anagram colouring.</p>

<p>The nice thing about this is that we can slice out a pathwidth-3 <em>separator</em> $S$ from a general outerplane graph and we are left with components that are each outerplanar, each have smaller pathwidth than the original graph, and are glued to $S$ by an edge. This last property is akin to <em>shadow completeness</em> and means we can prove:</p>

<div class="theorem">
  Outerplanar graph of pathwidth $k$ and maximum-degree $\Delta$ have anagram-free chromatic-*index* $O(k\Delta)$.
</div>

<p>(Note: The $\Delta$ here is only required to rule out trivial anagrams caused by paths of length 2.)</p>

<p>Finally, the subgraph $P^+$ consisting of the edges of $P$ and the triples of cut edges has constant degree.  We can use this fact to transfer our edge colouring of $P^+$ to a vertex colouring that is anagram-free, solving the open problem stated above:</p>

<div class="theorem">
   Outerplanar graphs of path $k$ have anagram-free chromatic number $O(k)$.
</div>

<p>This strengthens Wilson and Wood’s result from trees to outerplanar graphs and puts us right on the edge of the class of graphs that have anagram-free chromatic number bounded by their pathwidth.  My guess is that appropriate versions of the preceding ideas should carry through to 2-trees.</p>

<p>Related to this is a question posed by Wilson and Wood:</p>

<div class="problem">
  Is there a caterpillar whose anagram-free colouring requires 5 colours.
</div>

<h1 id="relations-to-other-colouring-problems">Relations to Other Colouring Problems</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Every non-repetitive colouring is a proper colouring, so $\chi(G)\le \pi(G)$</li>
  <li>Every anagram-free colouring is non-repetitive, so $\pi(G)\le \pi_\alpha(G)$</li>
  <li>A <em>linear colouring</em> is a colouring in which every path contains a colour that occurs exactly once. Every linear colouring is anagram-free, so $\pi_\alpha(G)\le \chi_{\mathrm{lin}}(G)$; see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09665">Kun, O’Brien, and Sullivan</a> who introduced linear colourings</li>
  <li>A <em>centered colouring</em> is a colouring in which every connected subgraph contains
a unique colour. Every centered colouring is a linear colouring, so $\chi_{\mathrm{lin}}(G) \le \chi_{\mathrm{cen}}(G)$</li>
  <li>The <em>treedepth</em> of a graph $G$ is the minimum height of any tree $T$ with the property that, for each $uw\in E(G)$, $u$ is an ancestor of $w$ in $T$.  The treedepth and the centered chromatic number is the same, so $\DeclareMathOperator{\td}{td}\td(G) = \chi_{\mathrm{cen}}(G)$; see Lemma 4.2 in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejc.2005.01.010">Nešetřil and Ossona de Mendez</a></li>
  <li>A <em>vertex ranking</em> is a colouring in which every path between two endpoints of the same colour contains a vertex of larger colour.  It turns out that vertex rankings and centered colourings are equivalent, so $\chi_{\mathrm{cen}}(G) = \chi_{\mathrm{vr}}(G)$; see Lemma 4.1 in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejc.2005.01.010">Nešetřil and Ossona de Mendez</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Summarizing:
\[
  \chi(G) \le \pi(G) \le \pi_\alpha(G) \le \chi_{\mathrm{lin}}(G)
   \le \chi_{\mathrm{cen}}(G) = \td(G)=\chi_{\mathrm{vr}}(G)
\]</p>

<p>We know that bounded degree graphs have constant non-repetitive chromatic number but that their anagram-free chromatic number can be nearly linear, so these two parameters are obviously very different.</p>

<p>One property of centered colourings are that the set of unique colours of $G$ form a cut-set.  Using this fact, it is not hard to show that, for $k\le n$, the $k\times n$ grid, $G_{k\times n}$, has $\chi_{\mathrm{cen}}(G_{k\times n}) \in\Omega(k\log(n/k))$.</p>

<h1 id="unmatchable-colourings">Unmatchable colourings</h1>

<p>Call a colouring <em>unmatchable</em> if every path has a colour that occurs an odd number of times. Clearly every unmatchable colouring is anagram-free, but not ever unmatchable colouring is a linear colouring. So the <em>unmatchable chromatic number</em> sits between the anagram-free and linear- chromatic numbers.</p>

<div class="problem">
  What is the unmatchable chromatic number of $P_n$, the $n$ vertex path?
</div>

<h1 id="partial-results">Partial results</h1>

<p>In any graph with layered separations of size $\ell$, we can colour with $O(p\ell\log n)$ colours so that each path of length at most $p$ is anagram-free.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, I think that in any graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ we can use entropy compression to colour with $O(p\Delta)$ colours so that any path of length at most $p$ is anagram-free.</p>
