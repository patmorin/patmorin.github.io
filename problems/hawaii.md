Many of these problems are listed on the workshop's [Coauthor site](https://coauthor.ulb.ac.be/Hawaiian%20Workshop%20on%20Parallel%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures)

# Instance-Optimality for Concurrent Binary Search

See the open problem 1 on coauthor

# Fine-Grained Complexity

See open problem 2 on coauthor

# Log Placement

This problem is listed [elsewhere on this site](log-placement.html).  This is also open problem 3 on coauthor.

# BPBC

See open problem 4 on coauthor.  This meta-problem is to find problems with fast BPBC algorithms.

# Offline Permutation on the GPU

This is also listed as Open Problem 4 on coauthor.

His question is whether permutations can be implemented efficiently on the GPU.  There is a fast algorithm for $n\ll w^2$, but no fast algorithm for $n\gg w^2$.

# Parallelizing Reverse Search

Open problem 8 on coauthor

# Parallel Persistent B-Tree

Open Problem 9 on coauthor.

# Solving Problems using Few Writes

Which problems can you solve using few writes.  An obvious candidate is 2D linear programming.


# External-Memory Algorithms for Geometric Graphs

Given a set of axis-parallel line segments, compute the connected components of its intersection graph, in the external memory model.

# LRU for Cache-Oblivious algorithms

Does the LRU page replacement policy work better on page access sequences generated by cache-oblivious algorithms?
