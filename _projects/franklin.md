This project, which is well underway, is about average-case analysis of Franklin's Leader Election Algorithm.  I already have a github repo named [franklin](https://github.com/patmorin/franklin) with LaTeX sources.  This is joint work that began at the 2017 Workshop on Probability and Combinatorics.
