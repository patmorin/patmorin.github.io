    <p>$\DeclareMathOperator{\obs}{obs}\DeclareMathOperator{\cupdotop}{\dot{\cup}}$For a set $P\subset \R^2$ of points and a set $R$ of connected subsets of $\R^2$, the visibility graph $V_R(P)$ of $P$ with respect to $R$ is the graph $G=(P,E)$ in which an edge $uw$ is in $E$ if and only the segment with endpoints $u$ and $w$ is disjoint from every element in $R$.  We say that $(P,R)$ is an <em>obstacle representation</em> of $G$.  The <em>obstacle number</em>, $\obs(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of obstacles in any obstacle representation of a graph isomorphic to $G$.</p>

<div class="problem">
  What is the maximum obstacle number of an $n$-vertex graph?
</div>

<p>It is known that there are $n$-vertex graphs with obstacle number $\Omega(n/(\log\log n)^2)$ (see <a href="http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v22i3p1">Dujmović and Morin</a>) and that every $n$-vertex graph has obstacle number $O(n\log n)$ (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04741">Balko, Cibulka, and Valtr</a>).
The lower bound is non-constructive; it shows that a random graph has high obstacle number with high probability.</p>

<div class="problem">
  Give an explicit construction of a graph with large obstacle number.
</div>

<p>The upper bound of $O(n\log n)$ starts by placing the vertices of $G$ in general position, but in such a way that there is a set $B$ of $O(n\log n)$ $\epsilon$-disk points that <em>block</em> every pair of vertices. (A disk $D$ blocks $u$ and $w$ if $x$ is in the interior of the line segment joining $u$ and $w$.)  Then, a careful perturbation of the vertices is used so that each set of edges that passes through a disk $D\in B$ becomes (in the neighbourhood of $D$) an arrangement of lines in which all lines are incident to one face.  In this way, a single obstacle near $D$ is sufficient to block any subset of the edges that passes through $D$.</p>

<p>If we take the limit as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$, then we obtain
a point set that can be blocked by $O(n\log n)$ points. If we want to improve this upper bound, then a natural place to start is to find a set of $n$ points that can be blocked by $o(n\log n)$ points.  This is already an open problem (see Conjecture 3 of <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.20382/jocg.v1i1a3">Pór and Wood</a>).</p>

<div class="problem">
  What is the fewest number of blockers required to block an $n$-point set in general position?
</div>

<p>Pinchasi conjectured that the answer is $\Omega(n\log n)$.  An upper bound of $n2^{O(\sqrt{n})}$ is due to <a href="https://www.math.nyu.edu/~pach/publications/midpoint.ps">Pach</a>, who actually shows gives an example of an $n$-point set in general position that has only $n2^{O(\sqrt{n})}$ midpoints.
(See my <a href="blockers-and-midpoints.html">open problems on blockers and midpoints</a>.)</p>

<p>The construction of Balko, Cibulka, and Valtr doesn’t given an $O(n\log n)$ upper bound because, in the limit $\epsilon=0$, the point set stops being in general position (it lives on two vertical lines).  This leads to another variant of the blocking question.</p>

<div class="problem">
  Let $S:(0,1]\to(\R^2)^n$ be a continuous family of $n$ point sets with the property that, for all $\epsilon\in(0,1]$, $S(\epsilon)$ is in general position and can be blocked by a set of $f(n)$ $\epsilon$-disks.  What is the minimum value of $f(n)$?.
</div>

<p>A solution to the preceding problem would not necessarily help with the obstacle number question, unless it has some special structure.</p>

<h2 id="counting-h-obstacle-graphs">Counting $h$-Obstacle Graphs</h2>

<div class="problem">
  What is the number of graphs with obstacle number $h$?
</div>

<p>Theorem 1 of <a href="http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v19i2p32">Mukkamala et al</a> gives an upper bound of $2^{O(hn\log^2 n)}$.  Theorem 4 in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04741">Balko, Cibulka, and Valtr</a> gives a lower bound of $2^{\Omega(hn)}$.</p>

<h2 id="obstacle-numbers-of-product-graphs">Obstacle Numbers of Product Graphs</h2>

<p>The product graph $G_1\times G_2$ of two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ is the graph with vertex set $V(G_1)\times V(G_2)$ and that contains an edge joing $(u_1,u_2)$ to $(w_1,w_2)$ if
$u_1w_1\in E(G_1)$ or $u_2w_2\in E(G_2)$.</p>

<div class="problem">
  What can we say about $\obs(G_1\times G_2)$ in terms of $\obs(G_1)$ and $\obs(G_2)$?
</div>

<h2 id="planar-graphs">Planar Graphs</h2>

<p>Less is known about obstacle numbers of planar graphs:</p>

<div class="problem">
  What is the maximum obstacle number of an $n$-vertex planar graph?
</div>

<p>A lower bound of 2 was recently shown by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03782">Berman et al</a>, who showed that the icosahedron (as well as another planar graph with 10 vertices) has obstacle number 2.  An upper bound of $O(n)$ comes from the fact that a planar drawing of an $n$-vertex planar graph has at most $2n-4$ faces and placing an obstacle inside each face gives an obstacle representation of this graph.  Actually, this bound has been reduced to $n-3$ by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06992">Gimble etal</a>.  The bound of $n-3$ is tight for planar representations of planar graphs.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06992">Gimble etal</a> also show that if $G$ is bipartite and planar, then $\obs(G)\le 1$.  This makes it plausible that planar graphs have bounded obstacle number.</p>

<h2 id="sparse-graphs">Sparse graphs</h2>

<p>The known graphs with large obstacle number (namely $G_{n,1/2}$) are dense. If we can’t find planar graphs with large obstacle number, then maybe we can find other sparse graphs with large obstacle number:</p>

<div class="problem">
  Is there a constant $d$ such that $d$-degenerate graphs have arbitrarily large obstacle number?
</div>

<h2 id="a-lemma">A Lemma</h2>

<p>An <em>outside obstacle</em> in an obstacle representation $(P,R)$ is an obstacle that is not bounded by visibility edges, i.e, there is a path from the obstacle to infinity that does not intersect any edge of $V_R(P)$. An <em>outside obstacle representation</em> of $G$ is an obstacle representation of $G$ that has an outside obstacle.  The <em>outside obstacle number</em> of $G$ is the minimum number of obstacles in any outside obstacle representation of $G$.</p>

<p>Here’s a lemma that might help that might be helpful for solving these kinds of problems. (It’s an easy generalization of Lemma 4.1
in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03782">Berman etal’s paper</a>).</p>

<div class="lemma">
  If $G_1$ and $G_2$ each have outside obstacle number $k$, then their disjoint
  union, $G=G_1\cupdotop G_2$ has obstacle number $k$.
</div>

<div class="proof">
  <p>Observe that $\obs(G_1)\ge k-1$ since, otherwise, we could add a useless outside obstacle to an obstacle representation of $G_1$ with less than $k-1$ obstacles to show that the outside obstacle number of $G_1$ is less than $k$. Also $\obs(G) &gt; \obs(G_1)$ since any obstacle representation of $G$ gives an obstacle representation of $G_1$ just by deleting vertices of $G_2$.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the only concern is that $G$ has an obstacle representation with $k-1$ obstacles and that these are all inner obstacles. Take any line, $\ell$ tangent to the convex hull, $C$, of these obstacles.  Then the same argument used in Lemma 4.1 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03782">Berman et al’s paper</a> shows that $G_1$ and $G_2$ each contain vertices on both sides of $\ell$.  But this is contradiction, since there is some pair of vertices $u\in V(G_1)$ and $w\in V(G_2)$ that are on the side $\ell$ that does not contain $C$.  These vertices are not blocked by any obstacle but they are not adjacent in $G$, so this is not an obstacle representation of $G$.</p>
</div>

<p>Since the disjoint union of planar graphs is also planar, the preceding lemma reduces the problem of finding graphs with obstacle number $k$ to the problem of finding graphs with outside obstacle number $k$.</p>
