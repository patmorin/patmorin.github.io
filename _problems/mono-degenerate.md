A graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is *monotone* if, for every $G\in\mathcal{G}$, every subgraph of $G$ is also in $\mathcal{G}$.  A graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is *small* if the number of $n$-vertex graphs in $\mathcal{G}$ is $2^{\Theta(n)}n!$.  Lots of interesting graph classes are small.

[Ã‰douard Bonnet, Julien Duron, John Sylvester, Viktor Zamaraev, Maksim Zhukovskii](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20522) show that every graph in a small monotone graph class is $d$-degenerate for some $d$ that depends on the constant in the $\Theta$ notation.

**Problem:** Find some interesting applications of this result
