Here's one from David Wood:

<div class="conjecture">
   Let $G$ be the $k$-nearest-neighbour graph of an $n$-point set in $\R^d$.  Then $G$ is a subgraph of $H\boxtimes P\boxtimes P\boxtimes\cdots\boxtimes P$ where $H=H(G)$ is a graph of treewidth at most $f(d,k)$, $P$ is a path, and the number of occurrences of $P$ in the product is $d-1$.
</div>

The conjecture is true for $d=1$ (easy) and $d=2$ (in our paper on the structure of $k$-planar graphs).
