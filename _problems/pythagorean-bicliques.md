An $(r,s)$ Pythagorean biclique is two sets of natural numbers $A=\\{a_1,\ldots,a_r\\}$ and $B=\\{b_1,\ldots,b_s\\}$ such that the distance from $a_i$ to $b_j$ is an integer, for every $i\in\\{1,\ldots,r\\}$ and every $j\in\\{1,\ldots,s\\}$.  Currently, the largest Pythagorean biclique is of size $(7,9)$.

<div class="problem">
   Is it true that for every $k$, there exists a $(k,k)$ Pythagorean biclique?
</div>

This question was posed by David Eppstein [on his blog](https://11011110.github.io/blog/2017/09/22/pythagorean-bicliques.html).
