# March 26, 2024:

**Conjecture:** (Nesetril and Ossona de Mendez) Let $\mathcal{X}$ be the class of $X$-minor-free graphs for some connected graph $X$.  Then the degenerate chromatic number of $\mathcal{X}$ is at most $\td(X)-1$.

Universal graphs of treedepth $k$ (the closure of complete $b$-ary trees of vertex-height $k$) show that this result is tight.  Any colouring of such a tree with $k-2$ colours will have a colour class that induces a graph of maximum degree at least $b$.

 Norin, ?, Seymour, and Wood show that the degenerate chromatic number of $\mathcal{X}$ is at most $2^{\td(X)}$.  

 Next week, Hussein will show me this proof.
